# Fun
### About
Fun is a research project that is ongoing to see if generated code out performs written and though-out code<br/>
we need people like you! Yes you! To help us figure it out try the code generator we have created and try coding<br/>
something by hand then make a pull-request showinng us your results and we will have the results in a results.md file<br/>
then this project will be archived thank you!
### Install
We recommend using the following Bash or Git script:
```shell
cd downloads
git clone https://github.com/FriendMyFriend/fun.git
```
### How did this come about?
Well with the rise of A.I we must see if code not written by humans is more effcient in helping coders<br/>
than just hand coding it or if they show the same results so if you do this experiment please show the time<br/>
it took you to create your project
### Why does Fun exist?
To try if A.I. is better than human coding and if it saves coding time! So we created this experiment<br/>
to test that theory so please we hope you participate!
